        <p>My background is a little bit of everything. Managment experience to sales to technical support. I have experience making websites such as this one and am in progress with bigger projects. I'm very adept at picking up new techniques and skills as well as using them properly. You can use that navbar to investigate further and make your own decisions towards working with me.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for coming to check out me and my work! Enjoy!</p>
